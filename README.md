 ApplePicker, Mission Demolition and Dungeon Roll!

The goal that was set for Dungeon Roll! was to utilize various skills and elements that I had learned from Roll-A-Ball, ApplePicker, and Mission Demolition. In order to do this, I decided to create a maze collectathon which included moving platforms from ApplePicker, a breakable wall from Mission Demolition, and collectible items from Roll-A-Ball. I also included other elements we have not learned: jumps, killzones, and respawn points.
